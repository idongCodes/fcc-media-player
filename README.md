For me, this is the most exciting project freeCodeCamp had me do thus far! It was moderately complex as I had the opportunity to dive into working pretty moderately with DOM and JavaScript methods for manipulating elements and arrays. Also did some light lifting with the DOM's Audio constructor and related properties. Thank you Quincy Larson!
